// Tutorial 10
// Question 5 - 7 
// Abstract Data Types, Header Files and Stacks
// Written by Catherine Cheng (z5310517)

// QUESTION 5

// Examples of data types
// - int, double, char

// What is an Abstract Data Type?
// - like an alias for a data typedef
// - stores data, but we don't know how it stores data 

// Examples?
// - queues, stacks 

// What is the purpose of a Header file?
// - typedefs, function declarations only - implementation is hidden

// What is the purpose of a Implementation file?
// - implement all functions and typedefs





// QUESTION 6
// I have two files, a list.h and a list.c that describe a particular form of list that I want to use.

// I then have a main.c that would like to use the functionality offered by the other two files.

// Which files need to #include the other files?
// - main.c and list.c need to #include "list.h"

// What is the compilation command that will combine these files into a single program?
// - dcc main.c list.c -o program_name
// - only need to compile .c files 



// QUESTION 7
// What is a stack?

// - example of abstract data type
// - last in first out
